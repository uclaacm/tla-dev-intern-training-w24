## What is Project Management?

To get an introduction to project management we'll hear from Rucha Patki, the 2020-2021 president of ACM at UCLA and a current PM at Salesforce! In this video, she deconstructs what PM *actually is* (there are three different types) what PMs do, tips about PMing, and specific asks on how to start and improve as a student PM!

## Agile

In Teach LA, we use Agile to organize our dev teams, provide structure, and set soft deadlines. Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development by working in small, incremental steps. Rather than working towards a “big bang” deadline of completing a project in its entirety, each project is broken up into smaller pieces called "sprints" to be completed in 1-4 weeks. 

We use 3 week sprints and the Scrum meeting framework to emphasize open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members. The Scrum meeting framework consists of four key "ceremonies" called Sprint Planning, Stand-up's, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

## GitHub Projects

In Teach LA, we use GitHub Projects to organize our sprints and assign tasks. A Project is basically a really fancy spreadsheet, task-board, and road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. 

* [GitHub Projects documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)

Each task in the Project has the following metadata:
* Title, linking to an active issue from the repository
* Assignees
* Status
* Points, the numerical difficulty of a task
* Sprint

### Points

Points provide an easy way for a project manager to prioritize and organize task assignment for an upcoming sprint. The more points a task has, the more difficult it may be and the more time it may take to complete. Points are based on the Fibonacci sequence as seen in the chart below.

### Velocity Chart

The velocity chart displays the average amount of work a  team completes during a sprint. Teams can use velocity to predict how quickly they can work through the backlog because the report tracks the forecasted and completed work over several sprints. The more sprints, the more accurate the forecast.

A team's recent velocity can be useful in helping to predict how much work can be completed by the team in a future sprint. Velocity is calculated by taking the average of the total completed estimates over the last several sprints.

This value should become more accurate and reliable over time, as more data becomes available and the team gets better at estimating issues.

The velocity chart is shared at Sprint Review to reflect on how to adjust a team's workload for future sprints.
